        as you can in a limited span of time. There are two modes: Single player and Multiplayer.

-Small Example-





                                        Avengers

                                          ^
                                          |
                                          |
                         Television <-- Movies --->     Production
                        /                 |
                       /                  |
                     \/_                  v

                The Office
                                        Acting

This will look as follows:


                                         (8)

                                          ^
                                          |
                                          |
                               (10) <-- Movies -->  (9)
                                          |
                             /            |
                           \/_            v

                         (3,6)           (6)

In this example, Movies is the category. Avengers, Acting, Production, Televesion, The Office are words associated with the categories.
